# CRRFNet
A demo of CRRFNet <br />
After the paper is published, the code will be made public. Before this, you can contact the author to request it(nj_wenbowang@163.com).
The code repository contains four samples from CRNJUST-v1.0, two of which are training samples and two are test samples, used to assist in code reproduction.<br />
The full data of the CRNJUST-v1.0 that support the findings of this study are available on request from the autho, upon reasonable request. <br />
The pre trained weights on the CRNJUST-v1.0 dataset can be [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UZruj-b1KbWNS0TawfI55fS1e6pfd0y/view?usp=sharing) from Google Cloud Drive. <br />
The following image shows the results of using pre trained weights to predict samples in "data/test". <br />
